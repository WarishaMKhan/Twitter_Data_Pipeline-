1. **Data Source (Twitter)**: The pipeline begins with data extraction from Twitter. This could involve gathering tweets, user information, or other data using the Twitter API.
2. **Python**: Python scripts are used to interact with the Twitter API, handling the extraction and initial processing or cleaning of the data. This step ensures that the data is formatted correctly before being stored or further processed.
3. **Apache Airflow**: Apache Airflow is employed to orchestrate the entire workflow. It manages scheduling, monitoring, and executing Python scripts to extract data from Twitter at regular intervals. Airflow runs on an Amazon EC2 instance to maintain the pipeline's infrastructure and automate the data flow.
4. **Amazon EC2**: The EC2 instance serves as the host environment for running Apache Airflow and Python scripts. It provides the computational resources required to manage the pipeline.
5. **Amazon S3**: After the data is processed and managed through Airflow, it is stored in Amazon S3. S3 acts as the cloud storage solution where extracted data is saved for further analysis, transformation, or backup.

Overall, this pipeline enables automated data extraction from Twitter, using Python for data handling, Airflow for orchestration, EC2 for hosting, and S3 for storage, facilitating efficient and scalable data management.
